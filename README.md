# Capstone_Project_Using_KNN---Using-Dataset-Iphone
Project on Polynomial Regression using Machine Learning Lifecycle to predict Whether Customer will purchase Iphone or not from the given store
Iphone Purchases are getting increased day by day and many stores wants to predict whether a customer will purchase an Iphone 
from thier store given their gender, age and salary.

Prediction  - Whether Customer will purchase or not

1. Follow the Machine Learning Life Cycle Steps.
2. Write proper Insights/Inference on each analysis
3. Do proper EDA on the columns and the data with graphs using seaborn and interpret the graphs.
4. Write proper print statements while writing the code. Proper rounding of the numbers is also required.
5. Prepare a presentation for both the projects seperately. The presentation should contain - 
	1. Objective
	2. Solution 
	3. Business Impact
6. Prepare a Word Doc for the entire end to end process with solution architecture and methodology. Also mention the time taken
for the use case to develop. Challenges faced and the complexity. Create a template which you can use further on other projects also.
10. Create a single Github repo for both the use case with proper name as "Prediction with Regression" and upload the zip datasets, zip graphs, .ipynb file, ppt, word doc.
